"""Deadlines, sticky error words and the stop of a failed launch (RFC #43949).

Each wait on another workgroup or rank has a deadline below the server's
watchdog timeout. On a timeout the wait sets a sticky error word on its GPU,
writes an error flag to every peer, fences, and stops the launch (a store to
the null page: a GPU fault at address 0x0), and with it the process. A wait
that sees a failure (its own GPU's words or a peer's flag) stops too. A launch
never runs on after a failed wait: its data-dependent addresses would come from
words that never arrived. A rank finishes a step only when each of its waits got
that step's data, so its tokens are correct; nothing is checked on the host.

The deadline comes from ``--watchdog-timeout`` (half of it, at most 60 s), and
one under 5 s is refused, so that a normal delay on one rank is not a failure
(SGLang's ``sglang.srt.monokernels.guards``). A satisfied wait costs nothing
more, and so does a pending one that the data reaches within ``CHECK_POLLS``
polls; a longer one checks the failure flags every ``CHECK_POLLS`` polls and its
deadline on the 100 MHz ``s_memrealtime`` clock from the first of those checks.
The guard loads nothing at launch entry: the deadline and the peers' addresses
are read only on those checks and on a failure.

The guard block lives in the launch's epoch buffer (int32 words):

====  ======================================================================
word  meaning
====  ======================================================================
0     the epoch (``epoch.py``)
1-2   the deadline in clock ticks (int64), written by the host at build
3     ``deadline``: 1 + the site of the first wait on this GPU that timed out
4     ``peer``: set when a wait saw a failure elsewhere
5     ``fault``: set by the test fault injection (``SGLANG_AMD_MONO_FAULT_INJECT``)
====  ======================================================================

A peer's error flags are ``FLAG_WORDS`` words at ``flags_offset`` of each
rank's peer buffer: rank r writes word r of every rank's flags, its own too.

The guard is set for the duration of a kernel's trace (``scope``); the waits
pick it up there, so a kernel only builds its guard once at the top.
