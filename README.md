# SGLang-AMD-Mono

## Introduction

**SGLang-AMD-Mono** is the monokernel library of the [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) framework for AMD Instinct GPUs. A monokernel is a persistent kernel that runs most of a decoder layer, including its attention, its mixture-of-experts block and both tensor-parallel all-reduces, in one or two launches. This removes the launch gaps and collective latency that dominate small-batch decoding.

The library implements SGLang's monokernel interface ([RFC #43949](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/43949)) and loads as an SGLang [general plugin](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docs/docs/hardware-platforms/plugin.mdx) (the `sglang.srt.plugins` entry point), which registers each model's spec under the monokernel backend `amd`. With `--monokernel-backend amd`, every decode and speculative-verify step that a spec serves runs on its kernels, and every other step runs SGLang's standard path.

> **Experimental:** `--monokernel-backend` is an experimental SGLang feature. The kernels, the models and setups they cover, and the plugin interface may change.

## Features

### Supported Models

| Model | GPU | Tensor parallel | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash | MI350X, MI355X (gfx950) | 2, 4 | All 40 layers in decode and DSpark verify steps of up to 48 rows, and the DSpark draft stages |
| GLM-5.3-Flash | MI355X (gfx950) | 2, 4, 8 | 41 of the 42 MoE layers, all but the last (one launch each), in decode steps of up to 8 rows (4 at TP2) |
| GLM-5.3 | MI355X (gfx950) | 4, 8 | All 75 MoE layers (one launch each), in decode and MTP verify steps of up to 8 rows (4 at TP4) |
| MiniMax-M3 (MXFP4) | MI350X, MI355X (gfx950) | 4 | The 57 sparse MoE layers in decode and EAGLE3 verify steps of up to 16 rows |

### Design

- **One or two launches per layer.** DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash runs two. K1 runs the attention's input mixing and projections and writes the KV cache. K2 runs the sparse attention, the output projections, the FFN mixing, the MoE and both all-reduces. On the indexer layers, K2i runs between them: it scores the FP4 index keys in one launch, and SGLang's top-k kernels select each row's top-k from its logits. GLM-5.3-Flash and GLM-5.3 run each covered layer as one launch. MiniMax-M3 runs one too: K1 (the input norm, the fused qkv and index projection, the q / k norms, RoPE, the KV and index-key writes and the index scores) runs in front of the block selection, the sparse attention, o_proj, the router, the MoE and both all-reduces, in one launch.
- **Graph-safe routing.** Each step is routed by its CUDA graph key alone, so every rank makes the same decision and a captured graph replays the decision made at capture.
- **Fail-stop synchronization.** Every wait on another workgroup or GPU has a deadline. A failed wait stops the launch on every rank, so no token from a failed step is returned.
- **In-place weights.** The kernels read the weights SGLang loaded. The few weights that need another layout or precision (MiniMax-M3's attention projections run in FP8) are copied once at startup, and each copy is logged.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- SGLang with the monokernel interface (`sglang.srt.monokernels`, in review as [sgl-project/sglang#44353](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/44353))
- ROCm with FlyDSL and AITER, as included in SGLang's ROCm images
- AMD Instinct MI350X or MI355X
- MiniMax-M3 also needs SGLang's page16 SHUFFLE K / V for AITER sparse attention ([sgl-project/sglang#41998](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/41998), on [#41708](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/41708)). Until both merge, `--monokernel-backend amd` refuses MiniMax-M3 and names them.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgl-project/sgl-amd-mono.git
cd sgl-amd-mono
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

```bash
SGLANG_USE_AITER=1 AITER_BF16_FP8_MOE_BOUND=0 python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
  --tp 4 \
  --speculative-algorithm DSPARK \
  --speculative-dspark-block-size 5 \
  --fp8-gemm-backend aiter \
  --enforce-shared-experts-fusion \
  --monokernel-backend amd
```

On gfx950 the decode graph capture fails in AITER's MoE without
`AITER_BF16_FP8_MOE_BOUND=0`. The flags are those of the serving tests
(`test/e2e/deepseek_v41_server.py`).

GLM-5.3, with MTP (its NextN layer drafts one chain; a verify step of 4 rows a
request runs the kernels at batch sizes 1 and 2 at TP8):

```bash
SGLANG_USE_AITER=1 python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path zai-org/GLM-5.3 \
  --tp 8 \
  --dsa-prefill-backend tilelang \
  --dsa-decode-backend tilelang \
  --speculative-algorithm EAGLE \
  --speculative-num-steps 3 \
  --speculative-eagle-topk 1 \
  --speculative-num-draft-tokens 4 \
  --monokernel-backend amd
```

MiniMax-M3, with an EAGLE3 draft:

```bash
SGLANG_USE_AITER=1 SGLANG_MINIMAX_M3_INDEX_TOPK_FREQ=1 python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path amd/MiniMax-M3-MXFP4 \
  --tp 4 \
  --quantization quark \
  --attention-backend aiter \
  --kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3 \
  --page-size 128 \
  --speculative-algorithm EAGLE3 \
  --speculative-draft-model-path Inferact/MiniMax-M3-EAGLE3-GQA \
  --speculative-num-steps 3 \
  --speculative-eagle-topk 1 \
  --speculative-num-draft-tokens 4 \
  --monokernel-backend amd
```

If the model, GPU or configuration is not supported, the server refuses to start and lists every reason.

## Contributing

Format code with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) (`pre-commit install`). Every module that reads SGLang internals declares them in `SGLANG_READS`. `test/unit/test_contract.py` checks each declared name against the installed SGLang, so an incompatible SGLang change fails on CPU.
